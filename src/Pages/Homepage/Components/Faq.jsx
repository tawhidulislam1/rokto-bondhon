                    <p>Study Together is a study community and a virtual study space that you can access 24/7 from anywhere. When part of our community you will be able to study live with other students from all around the globe üåè ‚Äì Asia, Europe, Oceania, Africa and America.
                        Can you imagine going to the library without actually having to go? On Study Together you can grab a snack or chat with a friend during your study break without being told off by the librarian.
                        Enter one of the study rooms to study, and let your neurons mirror other people‚Äôs behavior - seeing others studying will boost your own productivity.
                        As you study on Study Together your progress will be tracked and gamified, and you will also be rewarded for keeping it upüèÜ.</p>
